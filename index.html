            <h1>IMPORTANCE OF ENVIRONMENT:</h1>
            <B>INTRODUCTION:</B>
            The environment is a natural environment which helps humans, animals, animals, birds and natural flora
            on earth to live.

            Development of a healthy person is possible only in a clean environment, that is, the environment is
            directly related to daily life.



            Every reaction made by our body is related to the environment, due to the environment we can breathe and
            get pure water, etc., so everyone should understand the importance of the environment.

            <h2>
                IMPORTANCE OF ENVIRONMENT:</h2>
            All humans, animals, natural flora, trees, trees, weather, climate are all contained within the
            environment.

            The environment not only works to maintain balance in the climate and provides all the things necessary
            for life.

            Today, where science has promoted technology and technology and there has been a lot of development in
            the world, on the other hand, they are also responsible for increasing environmental pollution.

            Modernization, industrialization and the use of growing technology have adversely affected the
            environment.

            Man is harvesting trees and playing with natural resources due to his selfishness, due to which there is
            a lot of damage to the environment.

            Due to some man-made reasons, the atmosphere, hydrosphere etc. are being affected, the temperature of
            the earth is increasing and the problem of global warming is arising, which is quite dangerous for human
            health.

            Therefore, understanding the importance of the environment, all of us should cooperate in saving our
            environment.

            <h2>ENVIRONMENT AND LIFE:</h2>
            The environment and humans are incomplete without each other, that is, man is completely fearless on the
            environment, without environment, man cannot even imagine his life.

            Therefore, for the accomplishment of material happiness, a man should avoid exploiting nature.

            Air, water, fire, sky, land are the five elements on which human life rests and we get all of this from
            the environment.

            The environment not only takes care of our health as a mother but also provides us with mental peace and
            happiness.

            The environment is an integral part of human life, therefore, we should always be ready to protect the
            environment.
