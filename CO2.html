<H1>INFORMATION ABOUT CARBON DIOXIDE(CO2)</H1>

    <p>
        Carbon Dioxide is a colorless, odorless gas that occurs in small quantities in the earth's atmosphere naturally.
        The earth's ocean, soil, plants and animals release CO2. The formula of Carbon Dioxide is CO2. The CO2 molecule
        contains 2 oxygen atoms that each share 2 electrons with a carbon atom to form 2 carbon - oxygen double bonds.
        The atoms are arranged as so (OHT). This is called a 'linear molecule'.



        Carbon dioxide is commonly found as a gas and is never a liquid. It sublimes to a solid known as 'dry ice' which
        is used as a substitute for normal ice as it is a lot colder and doesn't melt.



        Humans and animals breathe out Carbon Dioxide, often referred to as the greenhouse gas, as a waste product.
        Plants take in this CO2 and use it to make food. This is called photosynthesis. During this process oxygen is
        released which is then breathed in by humans and animals. This procedure is repeated over and over and a natural
        balance is obtained. However this natural balance is disrupted by human activity. People of the world are
        putting more than 5.5 billion tons of CO2 into the atmosphere every year. 75% of this is caused from the burning
        of fossil fuels. These fuels are burnt all the time to run factories, power plants and vehicles. The main
        sources of CO2 emissions are electric utilities, residential buildings, industry and transportation. The other
        25% is induced by the destruction of the world's forests. The reason for this is that there are less trees and
        plants to take in the CO2 but there is just as many, if not more, humans and animals to breathe it out.



        The amount of CO2 in a planet's atmosphere affects the temperature of the planet. As more and more CO2 builds up
        in the atmosphere, less heat can escape and the planet gets hotter. The CO2 traps radiation from the sun like a
        greenhouse.
        At ordinary temperatures, carbon dioxide is quite unreactive; above 1,700 °C (3,100 °F) it partially decomposes
        into carbon monoxide and oxygen. Hydrogen or carbon also convert it to carbon monoxide at high temperatures.
        Ammonia reacts with carbon dioxide under pressure to form ammonium carbamate, then urea, an important component
        of fertilizers and plastics. Carbon dioxide is slightly soluble in water (1.79 volumes per volume at 0 °C and
        atmospheric pressure, larger amounts at higher pressures), forming a weakly acidic solution. This solution
        contains the dibasic acid called carbonic acid (H2CO3).

        Carbon dioxide is used as a refrigerant, in fire extinguishers, for inflating life rafts and life jackets,
        blasting coal, foaming rubber and plastics, promoting the growth of plants in greenhouses, immobilizing animals
        before slaughter, and in carbonated beverages.
